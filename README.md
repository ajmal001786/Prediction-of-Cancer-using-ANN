# Cancer Prediction Using an ANN Classification-Model

To forecast type cancer, I employed an artificial neural network classification model. I start with a basic neural network with two hidden layers and 550 epochs, however this leads to overfitting the model, so I use the EarlyStopping approach to eliminate overfitting, and then I use the Dropout Method to obtain nearly 99 percent accuracy on label prediction.
